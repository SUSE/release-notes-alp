# Summary

1. Create a new branch with name that includes: your username, the original branch name, and descriptive suffix (e.g. `lkucharczyk-alp10-newfeature`).
2. Submit the changes as a pull request.
3. Write one sentence per line.
4. If there is a related issue, use its Jira or Bugzilla identifier as the section ID (`[#jsc-SLE-1234]`), or if that is not possible, add it as a comment (`// jsc#SLE-1234`).

# Examples

These are written in [AsciiDoc](#source-format).

## Single paragraph (solution only)

```asciidoc	
[#jsc-SLE-3038]
==== Running XenStore in stubdom
 
Since Xen 4.9, you can easily configure XenStore to run in a `stubdom` instead of Dom0.
This has the advantage that a high Dom0 load no longer affects XenStore performance.
It is a prerequisite to being able to restart Dom0 without having to restart other guests.
```

## Challenge/solution style
```asciidoc	
[#jsc-SLE-3069]
==== QED image format no longer supported
 
The QEMU virtual disk image format is no longer supported.
 
Existing virtual disks using this format can still be accessed, but should be converted to a RAW or QCOW2 format if possible.
Using the QED format for new disks is not supported.
```
