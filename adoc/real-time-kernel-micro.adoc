=== Real-time Kernel
For the Intel/AMD 64bit architecture (x86_64) the real-time (rt) kernel is provided in addition to the default kernel.
Support for RT includes support for Kernel Live Patching on the RT kernel.
Note: When using the RT kernel, KVM is not supported, and workloads need to be run within containers
Containers need special treatment with RT.
