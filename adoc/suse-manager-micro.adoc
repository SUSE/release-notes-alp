=== Managing {product} with SUSE Manager

SUSE Manager can be used to manage {product} hosts. There are certain limitations:

* {product} host cannot be monitored with SUSE Manager
* SUSE Manager does not provide integrated container management yet. As a workaround, you can use Salt via cmd.run podman.
* SUSE Manager can manage the {product} hosts only with the Salt stack; the traditional stack is not supported
* Ansible control node cannot be installed on {product}

We intend to resolve these issues in the future maintenance updates of {product} on SUSE Manager.
