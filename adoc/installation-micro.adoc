** OEM image – self-installation image (Base OS, salt-minion, KVM + libvirt packages) for x86_64
** OEM image with RT kernel – self-installation image, no KVM support on this image for x86_64

Images other than QCOW or VMDK target bare metal deployments.

=== Additional container images
* SUSE Toolbox container for debugging, based on current {slea} 15 SP, provided via registry.suse.com
* PCP container image (unmodified)

=== High-level requirements
Use of SLE Micro without a container runtime is only supported when SLE Micro is used as a KVM host and workloads are installed into KVM virtual machines.
Running workloads directly on the OS is not supported, with the exception of system management software.

=== Installation modes

{productname} {this-version} only supports deployment via images.
An installer based installation method is not offered.

Customization of the installation process with the provided images can be done with Ignition and Combustion (pre-configured images and self-installing images).

We will offer select images with support for cloud-init with a later milestone.

=== Supported architectures

* Intel/AMD 64bit (`x86_64`)
* {arm} 64bit (`aarch64`)
* IBM Z (`s390x`)

=== Upgrade path

An online migration of existing {productname} 5.5 installations to {productname} 6.0 is possible and is fully supported.
Upgrading from {productname} 5.5 is only possible via the `transactional-update` tool.
For the upgrade procedure, refer to {doc-url}/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-upgrade-slemicro.html

=== Change in installation methods

With previous releases we supported manual installation via a {yast} based image.
With {productnameshort} we have dropped support for this installation method and only focus on RAW image based deployments.
The SelfInstall image variant has been extended to allow setting of various parameters to direct it and also enable an unattended installation using the SelfInstall image.

=== Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro
==== Unattended installation with Yomi (technology preview)

To learn how to install a system with Yomi, see the {suma} documentation, section Install using Yomi.
Installation with Yomi is a technology preview.

==== Deploying pre-built images

{productnameshort} is provided as raw images which can be deployed directly to a storage device, for example, a memory card, a USB stick, or a hard drive.
{productnameshort} is also provided as images for specific hardware device with a customized software selection.

For a procedure of deploying an image refer to {doc-url}/html/SLE-Micro-all/part-raw-image.html

In addition to media provided by {productnameshort} 5.4, this release includes qcow2 images for  aarch64 and x86_64.
