==== Remove `targetpw` mode in `sudoers`

The default `sudoers`/root configuration was confusing due to it duplicating the first user's password for the root account and relied on a unique `sudoers` setting (`Defaults targetpw`) that asked for the root's password instead of the user's for sudo commands.
This approach was uncommon and surprising compared to other distributions that either did not set a root password or set a separate one and used the user's password for `sudo`, aligning with most users' expectations.

This has been changed and by default `targetpw` is not used.
